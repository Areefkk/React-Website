# React-Web App
This project will enable us to learn the fundamentals of React by building a website which uses an API to fetch and display data with real-time updates. The website will display the most recently released movies via the API, with the ability to favourite them and search for previously released films and do the same.
## Setting up
- Install NodeJS and add to system PATH
- Create project folder 
- Initialise project with command "npm create vite@latest" 
- Select "React" as framework and select variant as "Typescript"
- CD into "Frontend" and install required dependencies with "npm install"
- Use the command "npm run dev" to run the application
